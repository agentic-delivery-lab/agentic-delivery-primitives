# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The draft Primitive release advances to `0.1.0-draft.6` and consumes
  Architecture draft `0.1.0-draft.24` at
  `7b1d21462f70c411e75ae67ce80dcf688c9973e8`, pinning the evaluation report
  contract 2.0.0 by its exact schema digest.
- Evaluation reports now carry a registered case-selection policy, explicit
  case stimuli and outcomes, and evaluator identity, independence, and
  calibration evidence required by report contract 2.0.0.
- The prior draft Primitive release advanced to `0.1.0-draft.5` and pinned
  Architecture draft `0.1.0-draft.20` at
  `d6af08cf503b9dc06f6b0f706c843b23cfe61a3e`.
- Expanded the deterministic content digest to cover evaluation contracts,
  datasets, runner code, runtime pins, and the CI workflow.
- Preserved the draft4 Architecture draft3 pin so the Architecture-to-Primitive
  release graph remains acyclic.
- Draft4 consumes Architecture draft `0.1.0-draft.3` at
  `d4714c9489fb14824ef0967903d34a73c3e437fb`; draft3 consumes draft2 at
  `9b06a4e2202e851cdc700921828aac49d4a90d9d`.
- Draft2 records source commit `a39267da377328dbfb1ed210a23b2628c224bed6`,
  the Architecture Authority pin, and the canonical source digest.
- The initial draft Primitive release records the immutable source commit
  containing the extracted skill-boundary correction.

### Added

- Added versioned synthetic datasets, pinned deterministic grader and baseline
  contracts, a manual-only semantic rubric, and replay reports validated
  against Architecture's immutable evaluation-report schema.
- Added offline replay of candidate and baseline repository-delivery validators;
  the adapter uses synthetic local Issue responses and performs no network or
  paid-model calls.
- Added independent semantic-review and adoption limitations to generated
  evaluation reports; findings point to the existing owner Issue without
  changing repository or Project state.
- Added the history-preserving extraction of reusable skills, the Codex
  delivery agent, and repository-delivery validators.
- Added primitive metadata, release, capability, and tool-policy contracts.
